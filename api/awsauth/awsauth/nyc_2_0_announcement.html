    <p>Hello CovidActNow API users,</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>
      We are reaching out to let you know about an upcoming change to how data
      for New York City is represented in our API.
    </p>

    <p>
      Historically, weâ€™ve represented data for NYC in such a way that all data
      from the 5 counties of New York City were aggregated into the New York County (fips: 36061). Queries for the other 4 counties (Kings, Queens, Bronx, and Richmond) would return a 404. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Going forward, we are removing the aggregation of all NYC county data into one county - API data will exist for each of the 5 NYC counties.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time, we have recently
      <a href="https://apidocs.covidactnow.org/api#tag/CBSA-Data">
        added support for CBSAs
      </a>
      to our API.
    </p>

    <p>
      CBSAs represent collections of counties that are socioeconomically linked.
      They are used to represent metropolitan and micropolitan areas.
    </p>

    <p>
      For those interested in the aggregate data for the New York Metro Area, it
      is available here:
    </p>

    <p>
      <a
        href="https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/cbsa/35620.json?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY"
        >https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/cbsa/35620.json?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      (Note that the metro area is broader than the bounds of New York City).
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong
        >We are planning on making the change to the API mid next week</strong
      >
      but please let us know if this is going to impact your use of the API
      adversely and we can adjust that timing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Best,
      <br />
