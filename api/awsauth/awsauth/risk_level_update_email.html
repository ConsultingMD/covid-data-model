    <p>Hi,</p>

    <p>
      Last Tuesday we modified our risk levels to include a 5th level -
      Severe Outbreak or Extreme risk. On Monday, December 8th we will
      be updating the API to reflect this.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have any code depending on 4 risk levels, you will need to update it to include
      the fifth risk level.
    </p>

    <p>
      This change directly affects the fields <strong>riskLevels.overall</strong> and <strong>riskLevels.caseDensity</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For more details on the new risk levels and how to update, see the
      <a href="apidocs.covidactnow.org/updates#upcoming-risk-level-update">risk level update documentation</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Best,
      <br />
