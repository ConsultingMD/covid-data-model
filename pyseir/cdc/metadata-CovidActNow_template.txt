    Forecast based on expert opinions in public health and epidemiology of infectious disease, thorough literature
    review and daily feed data in cases, deaths and hostpitalizations.

methods_long: >-
    The SEIR Model makes forecast of $Model_target_names by fitting prediction cases, deaths and hospitalizations to
    the observations. Quantiles of the forecast are derived by generate random parameter ensemble from the parameters'
    prior distribution, and simulating the MLE SEIR model with parameter sets from the parameter ensemble.
